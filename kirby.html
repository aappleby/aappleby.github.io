For someone with a lot of C++ programming experience, transitioning to VHDL or Verilog is a huge pain, both syntax-wise and conceptually.
<p>
There's another HDL out there called SystemC which allows you to express circuits using C++ and a class library, but the tools to translate a SystemC model into something you can program onto a CPLD or FPGA aren't freely available.

To help myself wrap my brain around what was actually happening in my circuits at a RTL level, I decided to write a very very simple digital circuit simulator.
<p>
It's called Kirby, it does very little, but it's capable of modeling the MCPU (Minimal CPU) project from OpenCores. That's not really saying much, but writing Kirby was quite enlightening.
