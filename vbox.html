VBox (development name) is a long(er) term project to develop an iPod-sized device that includes all the functionality of a basic electronics lab - oscilloscope, logic analyzer, signal generator, pattern generator, adjustable AC and DC power supply (with a few limitations due to the laws of physics), all controlled through a touchscreen interface.
<p>
There will be a number of intermediate projects before the final design, as I'm quite new to this whole electronics thing and will be testing out various designs.
<p>
Current goals - Everything running at 200 mhz, 2 channel 8-bit oscilloscope, 16 channel logic analyzer, signal generator with 10+ bits of fidelity, pattern generator with long (compressed) pattern support, power supply capable of 1 watt at 0-5 volts (off battery) or 10 watts at +/- 0-12 volts (off external power supply)
<p>
Oscilloscope - 2 channels, 200 mhz sample rate, 1 meg sample memory.
Logic analyzer - 16 channels, 200 mhz sample rate, 1 meg sample memory

(Update 5/12/2012 - Yeah, this was just a liiiitle ambitious, and I haven't worked on it in ages. I might go back to it in the future though.)
