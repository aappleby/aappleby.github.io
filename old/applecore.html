Applecore was a big (8' wide) spherical projection display built from scratch for Burning Man '08.

It displayed various pretty 3D effects that were supposed to interact with the people standing around it, but that part got scrapped as the webcams I purchased were too slow to be useful.

I'm impressed that the damn thing actually worked; there were a number of near-disasters in getting it out to the desert (van that was going to haul it died, mirror mount almost broke, seam between mirror mount and "porthole" cracked, spilled epoxy all over porthole trying to fix seam, dust storms during setup, yadda yadda yadda).

It was very pretty and people liked it.
