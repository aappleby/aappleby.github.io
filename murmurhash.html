MurmurHash is a hash function that I invented while trying to teach myself about cryptography.
<p>
It turned out to be faster than most existing 'fast' hash functions, so I published it. It's now on version 3, and the source code and some documentation here - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/">http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/</a>

The old MurmurHash site is here - <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/">http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/</a>
