Crowbar is (or will be ) an Arduino shield consisting of a CPLD, SRAM, fast (~100 mhz) programmable oscillator, power supply, and input buffers.
<p>
The goal for Crowbar is to make an Arduino capable of some "heavy lifting" tasks involving high-speed IO - logic sniffing, interfacing to high-speed ADC / DACs, that sort of thing.
<p>
Right now I'm still trying to learn the details of VHDL, but I've got a very very basic system running under Xilinx ISE and communicating with a 15 ns SRAM model - if the timing information is correct, it should be able to handle 50 mhz captures, and 100 mhz+ isn't unreasonable with a faster ram chip.
<p>
None of the parts are very expensive - the BOM should be well under $10 in < 100 unit quantities.
