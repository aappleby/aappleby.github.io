<h1>SMHasher</h1>
SMHasher is the test suite I wrote to measure the performance and collision resistance of MurmurHash. It's inspired by George Marsaglia's "Diehard" and Robert G. Brown's "Dieharder" random-number-generator test suites, and the source code is at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/">http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/</a>
